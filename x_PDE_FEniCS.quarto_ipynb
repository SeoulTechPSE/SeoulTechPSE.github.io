    "The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate how a variety of important PDEs from science and engineering can be solved using just a few lines of `DOLFINx` code. We start with the heat equation, then proceed to the nonlinear Poisson equation, the equations of linear elasticity, and the Navier–Stokes equations. These examples illustrate how to handle time-dependent problems, nonlinear problems, vector-valued problems, and systems of PDEs. For each case, we derive the variational formulation and implement the problem in `Python` in a way that closely mirrors the underlying mathematics\n",

    "\n",
    "As a first extension of the Poisson problem introduced in the previous chapter, we now turn to the time-dependent heat equation (also known as the time-dependent diffusion equation). This equation can be viewed as the natural generalization of the Poisson equation, which describes the stationary distribution of heat in a body, to the case where the distribution evolves over time. By discretizing time into small intervals and applying standard time-stepping methods, we can solve the heat equation as a sequence of variational problems, in much the same way as we solved the Poisson equation\n",

    "**The variational formulation**\n",

    "A simple approach to solving time-dependent PDEs with the finite element method is to first discretize the time derivative using a finite difference approximation. This reduces the problem to a sequence of stationary equations, each of which can then be written in variational form. We use the superscript $n$ to denote a quantity at time $t_n$, where $n$ indexes the discrete time levels. For example, $u^n$ represents the value of $u$ at time level $n$. The first step in a finite difference discretization of time is to evaluate the PDE at a chosen time level, such as $t_{n+1}$\n",

Here, we assume isotropic elastic conditions\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the PDE above could alternatively be written as a single vector equation for $u$, known as Navier’s equation, which governs the displacement field. However, it is often more convenient to keep the present representation when deriving the variational formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The variational formulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The variational formulation is obtained by taking the inner product of the elasticity PDE with a *vector-valued* test function $v\\in\\hat{V}$, where $\\hat{V}$ denotes the corresponding test function space, and integrating over the domain $\\Omega$:\n",

    "\t-\t\\int_{\\partial \\Omega} (\\sigma \\cdot n)\\cdot v \\,\\mathrm{d}s$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the colon operator denotes the inner product between tensors (the sum of pairwise products of all components), and $n$ is the outward unit normal to the boundary. The quantity $\\sigma \\cdot n$ is known as the traction or stress vector at the boundary, and it is often prescribed as a boundary condition. Here, we assume that the traction is prescribed on a portion $\\partial \\Omega_T$ of the boundary as $\\sigma \\cdot n = T$. On the remaining part of the boundary, we impose Dirichlet conditions on the displacement, which eliminates the corresponding boundary integral. Thus we obtain\n",

    "It can be shown that the inner product of a symmetric tensor $A$ and an antisymmetric tensor $B$ vanishes. Decomposing $\\nabla v$ into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts therefore implies that only the symmetric part contributes to the product $\\sigma : \\nabla v$, since $\\sigma$ is symmetric. Replacing $\\nabla v$ by the symmetric gradient $\\epsilon(v)$ leads to a slightly different, but equivalent, variational formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a(u, v) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sigma(u) : \\epsilon(v) \\,\\mathrm{d}x$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Scaling**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often advantageous to scale a problem, as this reduces the need to specify physical parameters and produces dimensionless numbers that capture the relative influence of different parameters and physical effects. We first develop the code for the original dimensional model and then run the scaled problem by appropriately adjusting the parameters. For the present application, scaling reduces the number of active parameters from six to two\n",
    "\n",

    "$$ -(\\lambda + \\mu)\\nabla (\\nabla \\cdot u) - \\mu \\nabla^2 u = f $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce dimensionless coordinates by scaling with $L$, and define $\\bar{u} = \\frac{u}{U}$. This leads to the dimensionless governing equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-\\beta\\,\\bar{\\nabla}(\\bar{\\nabla}\\cdot \\bar{u}) -\\bar{\\nabla}^2 \\bar{u} = \\bar{f}, \\quad \\bar{f} = (0,0,\\gamma)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta = 1 +\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}$ is a dimensionless elasticity parameter and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\gamma = \\frac{\\rho g L^2}{\\mu U} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "is a dimensionless number representing the ratio of the applied load $\\rho g$ to the shear stress term $\\mu \\nabla^2 u \\sim \\mu \\frac{U}{L^2}$ in the PDE\n",
    "\n",
    "One option for scaling is to choose $U$ such that $\\gamma$ is of order one, i.e., $U = \\frac{\\rho g L^2}{\\mu}$. However, in elasticity, this choice leads to displacements comparable to the size of the geometry. A more practical approach is to set $U$ equal to the maximum deflection of a clamped beam, for which a formula exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U = \\frac{3}{2} \\, \\rho g L^2 \\frac{\\delta^2}{E}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta = \\frac{L}{W}$ reflects the beam’s slenderness, and $E$ is the modulus of elasticity. The dimensionless parameter $\\delta$ is therefore very important in this problem (as expected, $\\delta \\gg 1$ is what justifies beam theory). Taking $E$ to be of the same order as $\\mu$, which is typical for many materials, we find that $\\gamma \\sim \\delta^{-2}$ is an appropriate choice. By experimenting with the code to obtain displacements that “look right” in plots of the deformed geometry, we select $\\gamma = 0.4 \\, \\delta^{-2}$ as our final value\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation code handles the dimensional problem with parameters $\\lambda,$ $\\mu,$ $\\rho,$ $g,$ $L,$ $W$. For the scaled problem, we simply set $\\mu = \\rho = L = 1,$ $W = \\delta^{-1},$ $g = \\gamma,$ and $\\lambda = \\beta$\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we address the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, which combine time dependence, nonlinearity, and vector-valued variables—challenges seen in earlier problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**The PDE problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations form a system of equations governing the velocity $u$ and pressure $p$ of an incompressible fluid:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial u }{\\partial t} + u \\cdot \\nabla u \\right) &= \\nabla \\cdot \\sigma (u, p) + f\\\\\n",
    "\\nabla \\cdot u &= 0\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\\tag{NS}\\label{eq:NS}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The right-hand side $f$ represents a given force per unit volume. As in the equations of linear elasticity, $\\sigma(u,p)$ denotes the stress tensor, which for a Newtonian fluid is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma(u, p) = 2 \\mu \\epsilon(u) - p I$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon(u)$ is the strain-rate tensor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla u + (\\nabla u)^T\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. Note that the momentum equation  is very similar to the elasticity equation . The difference lies in the two additional terms, $\\rho\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\cdot \\nabla u\\right)$, and in the different form of the stress tensor. These extra terms represent the acceleration of the fluid, balanced by the force $F = \\nabla \\cdot \\sigma + f$ per unit volume according to Newton’s second law of motion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variational formulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Navier–Stokes equations are more challenging than the time-dependent heat equation because they form a system of equations, rather than a single equation, and the system has a special structure\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the same approach as for the heat equation—replacing the time derivative with a simple difference quotient—we end up with a nonlinear system. Nonlinearity itself is not a problem, as we have already seen in the nonlinear Poisson equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difficulty comes from the saddle point structure of the system. Intuitively, a saddle point system has competing constraints: in this case, the velocity and pressure fields are linked through the incompressibility condition $\\nabla \\cdot u = 0$. This coupling makes standard solvers inefficient or unstable. To handle this efficiently, we need specialized iterative methods and preconditioners that respect the saddle point structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will apply a simpler and often highly efficient approach known as a *splitting method*. The idea is to treat the two equations in \\eqref{eq:NS} separately. There are many splitting strategies for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. One of the earliest is Chorin’s method. Here, we will use a modified version of Chorin’s method, the so-called incremental pressure correction scheme (IPCS), which provides improved accuracy compared to the original scheme at little additional cost\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPCS scheme involves three steps. First, we compute a tentative velocity $u^*$ by advancing the momentum equation using a midpoint finite difference scheme in time, but with the pressure $p^n$ from the previous time step. The nonlinear convective term is linearized by using the known velocity $u^n$ from the previous step: $u^n \\cdot \\nabla u^n$. Note that several alternative methods exist to linearize this term, such as the Adams-Bashforth method. The variational problem for the first step reads: for the $(n+1)$-th step, find $u^*$ such that\n",

In that case, setting $\\rho=\\mu=1$ in the original Navier–Stokes equations reproduces the scaled model\n",
    "\n",
    "For a specific engineering problem, one typically wants to simulate a particular fluid with its corresponding physical parameters. A general-purpose solver is therefore most naturally implemented in dimensional form, using the original physical parameters. However, nondimensionalization can greatly simplify numerical simulations. First, it reveals that all fluids behave in the same way: it does not matter whether oil, gas, or water flows between two plates, nor does the absolute flow speed matter—at least up to a critical Reynolds number beyond which the flow becomes unstable and transitions to turbulence of an entirely different nature. This means that a single simulation can effectively represent all types of channel flow. In other applications, nondimensionalization shows that it may be sufficient to prescribe only certain parameter ratios (dimensionless numbers) rather than the parameters themselves. This approach simplifies exploration of the input parameter space, which is often the main purpose of simulation. In practice, the nondimensional problem is frequently solved by fixing some dimensional input parameters to convenient values (often unity)\n",

    "#### Solving the eigenvalue problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the Laplace eigenvalue problem with adaptive mesh refinement. The finite element discretization is performed using `dolfinx`, while `PETSc/SLEPc` are used for the linear algebra and eigenvalue solver. The geometry is generated with `GMSH`\n",

    "**Implementation tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Threshold selection: Use percentile-based marking (e.g., top 25%)\n",
    "  * Scaling: Residual estimator naturally scales with mesh size\n",
    "  * Stability: Ensure non-negative error indicators\n",
    "  * Convergence: Monitor eigenvalue changes across refinement levels\n",

    "\n",
    "A static current of $J = 1\\,\\text{A}$ flows through the copper wires.\n",
    "Our goal is to compute the magnetic field B in the iron cylinder, the copper wires, and the surrounding vacuum\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the problem, we note that the cylinder extends far in the $z$-direction, so the field can be assumed to be independent of the $z$-coordinate. This reduces the problem to a two-dimensional cross-section in the $x$–$y$ plane\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with Maxwell’s equations in magnetostatics:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0, \\quad \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic flux density, $\\mathbf{H}$ is the magnetic field intensity, and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density.\n",
    "The constitutive relation connects $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{H}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\mu$ denoting the magnetic permeability of the medium\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Introducing the Vector Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, we may represent the magnetic flux density using a vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Substituting into Ampère’s Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Using $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H}$, Ampère’s law becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}\\right) = \\mathbf{J}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Reduction to 2D\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long cylinder aligned with the $z$-axis and a current flowing along $z$, symmetry implies that the vector potential has only a $z$-component:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A}(x,y) = (0,0, A_z(x,y))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the magnetic flux density lies in the $x$-$y$ plane\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Scalar Poisson Equation\n",

    "\n",
    "Since we cannot compute on an infinite domain, we truncate the problem by surrounding the cylinder with a sufficiently large disk. On the boundary of this disk, we impose the condition $A_z = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "The current density $J_z$ is prescribed inside the circular cross-sections of the copper wires. In the interior set of circles, we assign a current of $+1\\,\\mathrm{A}$, while in the exterior set of circles, we assign a current of $-1\\,\\mathrm{A}$. This ensures that the net current in the domain is balanced, making the problem well-posed and allowing for a consistent computation of the magnetic field throughout the iron, copper, and vacuum regions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variational formulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the variational problem, we multiply the governing PDE\n",

    "\n",
    "On the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$, we have prescribed $A_z = 0$, which implies that the test function $v$ also vanishes there. Consequently, the boundary integral disappears, leaving us with the variational formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a(A_z, v) = L(v)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a(A_z, v) = \\int_\\Omega \\mu^{-1} \\nabla A_z \\cdot \\nabla v \\,\\mathrm{d}x, \\qquad\n",
    "L(v) = \\int_\\Omega J_z v \\,\\mathrm{d}x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the problem reduces to finding $A_z \\in V$, where $V$ is the appropriate function space with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a(A_z, v) = L(v) \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meshing a complex structure with subdomains**\n",

    "We now turn to the practical implementation of the problem. The first step is to create the computational mesh. We can construct this geometry in `GMSH`. Each physical region (iron, copper wires, vacuum, and outer boundary) is tagged with unique markers. These markers are preserved when the mesh is imported into `dolfinx`, and they allow us to assign different material parameters and source terms"

    "For any numerical method, one of the most fundamental questions is its convergence rate: how fast the error decreases as the resolution is increased (i.e., as the mesh size is decreased)\n",

    "In the finite element method, this typically involves proving—either theoretically or empirically—that the error $\\| u - u_h \\|$ is bounded by a constant times the mesh size $h$ raised to some power $p$, that is,\n",

    "$$\\| u - u_h \\| \\le C \\, h^p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some constant $C$ independent of the mesh. The number $p$ is called the convergence rate of the method. Note that different norms, such as the $L^2$-norm or the $H^1$-norm, generally yield different convergence rates\n",
